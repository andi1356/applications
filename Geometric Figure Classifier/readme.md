Created a Geometric Figure clasifier 

In this project using Tensorflow Library in Python I managed to create a Geometric Figure Classifier. Basically it reads images from a Database(which I created) and returns the type of the Geometric Figure('empty_polygon', 'empty_triangle', 'full_polygon', 'full_triangle', 'hole_polygon', 'hole_triangle'), examples of these images can be found in the "predict_test folder.
