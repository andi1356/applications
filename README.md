I enjoy big challenges because those are the ones that come with big rewards! That being said this repository holds some of the projects I developed along the years as I studied diverse programming languages and functionalities of each until I settled with one of them, Python. Right now I am focused in mastering Python and writing clean and well commented code that I can read ten years later and be able to understand.
